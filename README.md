# odin-calculator

## Description
A basic calculator, in your browser!

My iteration of this project adheres to the guidelines set out by the maintainers of **The Odin Project**, a self-paced curriculum for learning web development (links at the bottom).

**Why did I complete this project?:** To combine the HTML, CSS, and JS skills that I've learned in the Odin Project Foundations course.

## What I Learned
- Event Delegation and Event Bubbling: With event delegation, you can use a single event listener on a parent element (like a `numpad-container` div) to handle events from its child elements (such as each button in a numpad). This is possible because of event bubbling, where events propagate from the innermost element to outer elements in the DOM.
- How to use `preventDefault()` to prevent default behavior when an event triggers (e.g. preventing the "quick find" browser shortcut from activating when trying to divide using the `/` key) 
- Fall-through cases: If you leave off the `break` keyword after a case in a `switch` statement, the code will ‚Äúfall through‚Äù to the next case. This is useful for giving multiple keys/cases (like `=` and `Enter`) the same logic.  
- The `includes()` method is useful for checking if a user's keypress is included in an array of allowed keys, so you can properly handle keyboard input.
- How to use the `slice()` method to output a string with 1 fewer character to create a backspace button.
